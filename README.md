# Task Management System
A web-based application that allows users to manage tasks, assign tasks to others, set due dates and priorities, and track progress. .Net and Angular

## Project Planning

### 1. Setting up the backend environment:
- Setup and install a relational database SQL Server or PostgreSQL with Docker
- Create a new .NET Core web application project using Rider with the packages and dependencies

### 2. Designing the database schema:
- Decide on the tables and columns needed for storing task information and user data
- Create a database schema using Entity Framework Core Code-First or Database-First approach

### 3. Implementing the backend API endpoints:
- Create API endpoints using Web API to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks and users
- Implement authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or ASP.NET Core Identity

### 4. Testing the backend API endpoints:
- Using tools like Postman or Swagger to test the API endpoints and ensure they work as expected

### 5. Setting up the frontend environment:
- Install Node.js and Angular CLI
- Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI

### 6. Designing the user interface:
- Create UI wireframes and design layouts using Figma
- Convert the designs into Angular components using Angular Material and custom styles

### 7. Implementing the frontend:
- Implement the Angular components and services to interact with the backend API
- Use RxJS for reactive programming and observables to manage asynchronous operations

### 8. Testing the frontend:
- Test the frontend UI using tools like Karma and Jasmine
- Test the integration between the frontend and backend using end-to-end testing tools like Protractor or Cypress

### 9. Deployment of the application:
- Deploy the backend API to a cloud hosting platform like Azure or AWS
- Deploy the frontend to a web server or cloud hosting platform like Firebase or Netlify

### 10. Monitoring and maintainance of the application:
- Set up monitoring and logging tools like Azure Application Insights or ELK Stack to monitor the application's performance and detect errors
- Schedule regular maintenance and updates to fix bugs and improve the application's functionality and security.
